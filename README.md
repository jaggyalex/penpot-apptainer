# penpot-apptainer
The purpose of this project is to have an apptainer-friendly script for installing and running.

## Why not just use docker?
Docker is nice and all, but for some systems, it is not allowed (like High Performance Systems). And, of course, this is a nice little challenge.

If you stumble upon this, just know, I am working on it and this will get updated... eventually.
